    'This is the Jasper reports library for Convertigo Low Code Platform. Use this Library to generate PDF Reports  on data. The library is based on JasperSoft reporting library.
    
    ## Usage
    
    You can provide a CSV files and a .jrxml report file to the library and call the GenerateReport Sequence. This will output a PDF report in the provided output path.
    
    ## Creating .jrxml files
    
    These report description files can be authored using JaperSoft Studio (Download from [https://community.jaspersoft.com/download-jaspersoft/community-edition/] 
    
    Your JRXML file must define a ROOT_PATH parameter to be used as prefix to any resource such as images used ion the report. See the data/Cherry_Landscape.jrxml sample
    
    ## Running the testcase
    
    Run the testCase ''TestOK'' to generate a sample PDF report. You will find the PDF report in the data/report.pdf file.
    
    ## File Paths
    
    All file paths follows Convertigo file path resolution :
    * .// is relative to the library project
    * ./ is relative to the workspace
    * Absolute path will not be modified
    
    So if you want to resolve file paths before calling the library you can use 
    
    <code> 
    	ResolvedPath = Engine.theApp.filePropertyManager.getFilepathFromProperty(pathToresolve, context.projectName)
    </code>
